  DNS<img src="https://img.icons8.com/all/500/dns.png" width="100px" alt="accessibility text"> | DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP
web server<img src=" https://w7.pngwing.com/pngs/508/402/png-transparent-web-server-world-wide-web-icon-vpn-s-computer-network-globe-world.png"  width="100px"> | A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.
 application server<img src="https://www.pinclipart.com/picdir/middle/40-402329_computer-servers-application-server-computer-icons-database-server.png" width="100px"> |   Hosts web apps (computer programs that run inside a web browser) allowing users in the network to run and use them, without having to install a copy on their own computers. Unlike what the name might imply, these servers need not be part of the World Wide Web; any local network would do. 
 firewall<img src="https://st.depositphotos.com/1853861/4172/v/450/depositphotos_41724719-stock-illustration-firewall-icon.jpg " width="100px"> | A firewall is a network security system designed to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. Firewalls can be implemented as both hardware and software, or a combination of both. 
load balancer<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/AWS_Simple_Icons_Networking_Amazon_Elastic_Load_Balancer.svg/1024px-AWS_Simple_Icons_Networking_Amazon_Elastic_Load_Balancer.svg.png " width="100px"> |A load balancer is a device that acts as a reverse proxy and distributes network or application traffic across a number of servers. Load balancers are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability of applications.
  database<img src=" https://static.thenounproject.com/png/36146-200.png" width="100px">|A database is a systematic collection of data. They support electronic storage and manipulation of data. Databases make data management easy. 
 SSL<img src=" https://cdn3.iconfinder.com/data/icons/got-idea-vol-2/128/lock_ssl-512.png" width="100px"> | Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a standard security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a clientâ€”typically a web server (website) and a browser, or a mail server and a mail client
